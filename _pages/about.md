<p>As an AI leader with 15+ years of experience, I have consistently driven innovation across global R&D and enterprise initiatives. At IBM Research, I progressed from researcher to senior leadership roles, managing cross-functional teams and steering high-impact programs. Currently based at the <a href="http://www.ibm.com/">IBM TJ Watson Research Center, New York</a>, I lead efforts to enhance reasoning, planning, and agentic workflows in enterprise-grade large language models. My work directly powers the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/granite">Granite series</a> and next-gen capabilities within <a href="https://watsonx.ai/">WatsonX</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve served as Program Director for IBM’s Neuro-Symbolic AI program, overseeing 50+ researchers globally and founding strategic AI initiatives that continue to shape the field. My research has yielded 20+ US patents and 80+ peer-reviewed publications. I've delivered 50+ keynotes and invited talks at venues like IJCAI, ICSE, and Dallas AI, and been invited to speak at top global universities. A recognized thought leader with 14K+ LinkedIn followers, I remain committed to translating cutting-edge AI research into real-world impact.</p>

<p>In addition to my work at IBM, I serve as Executive Advisory Board member at <a href="https://centaurinstitute.org/">Centaur AI in USA</a>, Scientific & Industrial Advisory Board member at the <a href="https://ncai.pk/">National Center of Artificial Intelligence, Pakistan</a>.</p>

<p>My mission is to lead innovative, responsible AI efforts that drive measurable outcomes and support future-ready organizations. I welcome opportunities to collaborate with visionaries seeking to shape the next frontier of AI.</p>
