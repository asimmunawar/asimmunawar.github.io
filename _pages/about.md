<p>As an AI expert with 15+ years of professional experience, I have led successful projects across multiple industries, advancing technologies and driving innovation. In my 6+ years of management at IBM Research, I have overseen initiatives that push the boundaries of AI while fostering team development. Currently at <a href="http://www.ibm.com/">IBM TJ Watson Research Center, New York</a>, I am spearheading research to enhance enterprise-grade large language models with advanced agentic workflow and develop new features for <a href="https://watsonx.ai/">WatsonX</a>. 

<p>As a recognized thought leader, I contribute to advisory boards for several organizations and regularly deliver keynote presentations. I take pride in building high-performing teams and ensuring their success in dynamic, collaborative environments. My work has consistently focused on driving innovation and delivering real-world solutions that create a tangible impact.</p>

<p>I also serve as Tech Advisory Board member at <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/">Packt in India</a> (remote work), Scientific and Industrial Advisory Board member at the <a href="https://ncai.pk/">National Center of Artificial Intelligence-NCAI Pakistan</a>, and Executive advisory board member at <a href="https://centaur.ai/">Centaur AI in New York</a>.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, I am eager to lead cutting-edge projects, develop innovative AI solutions, and collaborate with forward-thinking organizations to shape the future of technology. I remain committed to fostering growth and achieving meaningful results that push the boundaries of what AI can accomplish.</p>
